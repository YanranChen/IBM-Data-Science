    "# Languages of Data Science\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "---\n",
    " - Identify the criteria and roles for determining the language to learn.\n",
    " - Identify the users and benefits of Python.\n",
    " - Identify the users and uses of the R language.\n",
    " - Define SQL elements and list their benefits.\n",
    " - Review languages such as Java, Scala, C++, JavaScript, and Julia.\n",
    " - List the global communities for connecting with other users.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python\n",
    "---\n",
    " - open source\n",
    " - clear and readable syntax.\n",
    " - has a huge global community and a wealth of documentation\n",
    " - For data science, you can use python's scientific computing libraries like Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.\n",
    " - Python can also be used for Natural Language Processing (NLP) using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK).\n",
    " - Python community has a well-documented history of paving the way for diversity and inclusion efforts in the tech industry as a whole. - \n",
    "\n",
    "## R\n",
    "--- \n",
    " - free software\n",
    "   - Open source vs free software\n",
    " - R language’s array-oriented syntax makes it easier to translate from math to code for learners with none or minimal programming background. \n",
    " - the world’s largest repository of statistical knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "## SQL\n",
    "---\n",
    " - SQL is different from other software development languages because it is a non-procedural language.\n",
    " - SQL’s scope is limited to querying and managing data.\n",
    " - SQL was designed for managing data in relational databases.\n",
    " - SQL behaves like an interpreter between you and the database.\n",
    " - And if you learn SQL and use it with one database, you can apply your SQL knowledge to many other databases easily.\n",
