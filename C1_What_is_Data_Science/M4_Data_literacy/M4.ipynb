    " - Technical metadata\n",
    "    - defines the data structures in data repositories or platforms, primarily from a technical perspective\n",
    "    - typically stored in specialized tables in the database called the System Catalog\n",
    " - Process metadata\n",
    "     - describes the processes that operate behind business systems such as data warehouses, accounting systems, or customer relationship management tools\n",
    " - Business metadata\n",
    "     - information about the data described in readily interpretable ways\n",
    "     - for business-minded users to find data which is meaningful and valuable to them and know where that data can be accessed from\n",

    "A data lake is a storage repository that can store large amounts of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data in their native format, classified and tagged with metadata. \n",
    "So, while a data warehouse stores data processed for a specific need, a data lake is a pool of raw data where each data element is given a unique identifier and is tagged with metatags for further use.\n",
    "- Retain all source data, without any exclusions\n",
